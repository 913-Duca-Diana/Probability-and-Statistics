# Probability-and-Statistics
BBU 3rd semester course

Laboratory 1

1.For the matrices A and B,print the matricesC=A−B,D=A·B andE= [eij], where ij=aij·bij.

2.Forx∈[0,3], graph on the same set of axes the functions x5/10,x*sinx and cosx,in different colors and linestyles.  
Display a title and a legend on your graph.  Thenplot them on different pictures, but in the same window.

Laboratory 2

A coin is tossed 3 times. LetX denote the number of heads that appear.
a) Find the probability distribution function of X. What type of distribution does X have?
b) Find the cumulative distribution function of X,FX.
c) FindP(X= 0) andP(X6= 1).
d) FindP(X≤2),P(X <2).
e) FindP(X≥1),P(X >1).
f) Write a Matlab code that simulates 3 coin tosses and computes the value of thevariableX.
